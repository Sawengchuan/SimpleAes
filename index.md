# Simple Aes

Simple Aes is a program for encryption/decryption using AES, that I always wanted to make.
Main reason is to serve as code documentation for personal reference on AES encryption.

The program is created using .net 6 and Winforms. 
No dependencies on any third party package, and no internet connection needed to function.
Thus no data from users will be collected.

Options keep to minimal, parameters/variables that essential for AES are hidden from users.
Only password and file path needed for encryption and decryption function.

This program will also be submitted to Windows Store as UWP App, using Windows Application Packaging Project, as part of the .net 6 learning process.


## Disclaimer
The program is provided free of charge.

Although before encryption process, the program will backup the original file, but in case anything goes wrong, under no circumstances will 
the Developer be held responsible or liable in any way for any claims, damages, losses, expenses, costs or liabilities.

I have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

## Privacy Policy
No data will be collected, period
Zero.
